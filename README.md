Machine learning
I completed Andrew Ng's/Stanford University's machine learning course on Coursera, but instead of using the Matlab templates provided by the course, I implemented everything from scratch in Python.

## Contents:

* Ex1: Linear regression

With one variable and with multiple variables.

* Ex2: Logistic regression

Including regularization.

* Ex3: Multi-class classification and neural networks

Handwritten number recognition using two different methods: one-vs-all logistic regression, and forward propagating a pre-trained neural network.

* Ex4: Neural networks learning

Build and train a neural network, including backpropagation, and use it for handwritten number recognition.

* Ex5: Regularized linear regression and bias vs variance

Including learning curves and polynomial regression.

* Ex6: Support Vector Machines

6.1: Demonstrate scikit-learn SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels on some sample 2D datasets.

6.2: Build an email spam classifier using natural language processing and a scikit-learn SVM.

* Ex7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

7.1: Build a k-means clustering algorithm and use it for image compression.

7.2: Build a PCA algorithm and use it for image compression and for visualisation.

* Ex8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

8.1: Anomaly detection using a multivariate Gaussian model. Precision, recall, F1 score.

8.2: Build a recommender system and use it to recommend movies.
