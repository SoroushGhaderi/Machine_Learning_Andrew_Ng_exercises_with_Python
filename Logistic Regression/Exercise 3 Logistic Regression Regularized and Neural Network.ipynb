    "In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. Before starting the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are included below).\n",

    "Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) for all arrays and matrix operations, [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, and [`scipy`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) for scientific and numerical computation functions and tools."

    "\n",
    "You are given a data set in `ex3data1.mat` that contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits (This is a subset of the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) handwritten digit dataset). The `.mat` format means that that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. We use the `.mat` format here because this is the dataset provided in the MATLAB version of this assignment. Fortunately, python provides mechanisms to load MATLAB native format using the `loadmat` function within the `scipy.io` module. This function returns a python dictionary with keys containing the variable names within the `.mat` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5000 training examples in `ex3data1.mat`, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix `X`. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix `X` where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",

    "The second part of the training set is a 5000-dimensional vector `y` that contains labels for the training set. \n",
    "We start the exercise by first loading the dataset. Execute the cell below, you do not need to write any code here."
