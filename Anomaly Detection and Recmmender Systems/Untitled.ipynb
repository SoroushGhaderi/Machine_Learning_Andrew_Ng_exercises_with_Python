    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server. While your servers were operating, you collected $m = 307$ examples of how they were behaving, and thus have an unlabeled dataset $\\{x^{(1)}, \\dots, x^{(m)}\\}$. You suspect that the vast majority of these examples are “normal” (non-anomalous) examples of the servers operating normally, but there might also be some examples of servers acting anomalously within this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use a Gaussian model to detect anomalous examples in your dataset. You will first start on a 2D dataset that will allow you to visualize what the algorithm is doing. On that dataset you will fit a Gaussian distribution and then find values that have very low probability and hence can be considered anomalies. After that, you will apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger dataset with many dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start this exercise by using a small dataset that is easy to visualize. Our example case consists of 2 network server statistics across several machines: the latency and throughput of each machine. "
